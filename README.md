In this repository(App UI), there are no functionality features contained. Just the UI itself. 
Even though I have tried the Instagram in the light mode, The night mode version of Instagram's clone code has been uploaded. 
But I will attach the screenshots of both mode, so it can be easier to picture.

Because I have not tried much to make the exact copy of Instagram but the structure, Icons and locations of widgets may differ from the current version of Instagram.
